1. What’s React’s context API?
 - It’s a way to transport data from a top level component to a child component without using props.
 - It opens up a “tunnel” between Provider and Consumer components.
2. Why is Apollo Client framework agnostic?
 - Because the Apollo Client can be used with any view-layer solution.
 - Because there exist connection libraries to bridge between data-layer and view-layer.
3. Why do you have implicit access to the Apollo Client in your React components?
 - Because React’s context API allows one to inject the Apollo Client instance to the component tree.
 - Because its possible to perform queries and mutations from within the component tree without using the Apollo Client instance directly.
 - Because it is passed to the Provider component which uses React’s context API under the hood.
4. Why is the Provider component used as top level component?
 - Because Provider components are used to give the whole component tree access to information.
 - Because then the Consumer components can be used somewhere down the component tree to access information.
 - Because it can use its children property to render the whole component tree below.
