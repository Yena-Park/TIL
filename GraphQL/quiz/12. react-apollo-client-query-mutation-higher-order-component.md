1. When should you use a Render Prop over a Higher-Order Component?
 - Having access to the local state of the component where the Render Prop is
used.
 - Having a more intuitiv way of using props from the component in the Query
and Mutation components.
2. When should you use a Higher-Order Component over a Render Prop?
 - Having a clearer separation between data-layer and view layer.
 - Keeping your view-layer concise by co-locating both layers instead of inserting the data-layer into the view-layer.
3. Whatâ€™s the best strategy when using render props to avoid deep Query/Mutation
component nesting.
 - Splitting up the component in smaller concise components that are focused
on only a few or one querie(s)/mutation(s).
 - Having a threshold of allowed nested nested Query/Mutation components
which should be allowed to be used in one component.
 - Using Higher-Order Components over Render Props when it would make sense.
