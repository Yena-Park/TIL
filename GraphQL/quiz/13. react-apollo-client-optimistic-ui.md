1. Why is there only one Mutation component needed for the updateSubscription instead of two which were needed for the Star/Unstar feature?
 - Because the GitHub's GraphQL API has dedicated mutations for the Star and Unstar mutations.
 - Because the Watch mutation has an additional argument to toggle the subscription.

2. What is optimistic UI?
 - A way to mimic a synchronous UI.

3. Why does the count of watches update immediately as well?
 - Because the function from the update prop runs twice.
 - Because the function from the update prop runs once with the optimistic response.

4. What can be done to keep Mutation components concise?
 - Extract its props as variables.
 - Use Higher-Order Components instead.
