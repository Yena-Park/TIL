Falsy values and truthy values
===============================
Falsy Values : undefined, null, 0, ' ', NaN
Truthy Values : NOT valsy values
```javascript
var height = 0;

if(height){
 console.log('Variable is defined');
}else{
  console.log('Variable is NOT defined'); //this will be shown as output
}
```

Equality operators
==================
Abstract(loose) Equality Comparison (==)
---------------------------------
Loose equality compares two values for equality, after converting both values to a common type.  After conversions (one or both sides may undergo conversions), the final equality comparison is performed exactly as ```===``` performs it.  Loose equality is symmetric: ```A == B``` always has identical semantics to ```B == A``` for any values of ```A``` and ```B``` (except for the order of applied conversions).
```javascript
23 == '23' //true
```

Strict Equality Comparison (===)
--------------------------------
Strict equality compares two values for equality. Neither value is implicitly converted to some other value before being compared. If the values have different types, the values are considered unequal. Otherwise, if the values have the same type and are not numbers, they're considered equal if they have the same value. Finally, if both values are numbers, they're considered equal if they're both not ```NaN``` and are the same value, or if one is ```+0``` and one is ```-0```.
```javascript
23 === '23' //false
```

Function
========
A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword,  followed by:
* The name of the function.
* A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
* The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.
```javascript
function calculateAge(birthYear){
  return 2018 - birthYear;
}

var ageJohn = calculateAge(1990);
var ageMike = calculateAge(1948);
var ageJane = calculateAge(1969);

console.log(ageJohn); //28

function yearsUntilRetirement(year, firstName){
  var age = calculateAge(year); //we can use other function in this function
  var retirement = 65 - age;

  if(retirement > 0){
    console.log(firstName + ' retires in ' + retirement + ' years.');
  }else {
    console.log(firstName + ' is already retired');
  }
}

yearsUntilRetirement(1990, 'John'); //John retires in 37 years.
yearsUntilRetirement(1948, 'Mike'); //Mike retires in 37 years.
yearsUntilRetirement(1969, 'Jane'); //Jane retires in 37 years.
```

Function Statements and expressions
----------------------------------
```javascript
var whatDoYouDo = function(job, firstName) {
  switch(job){
    case 'teacher':
      return firstName + ' teaches students how to code';
    case 'driver' :
      return firstName + ' drives an uber';
    case 'designer' :
      return firstName + ' designs beautiful website';
    default : 
      return firstName + ' does something else'
  }
}

console.log(whatDoYouDo('teacher', 'John'));
console.log(whatDoYouDo('designer', 'Mike'));
console.log(whatDoYouDo('retired', 'Jane'));
```
