The Ternary Operator
===================
The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the ```if``` statement.

```javascript
age >= 18 ? console.log(firstName + ' drinks beer') : console.log(firstName + ' drinks juice');
```
```javascript
if(age >= 18){
  console.log(firstName + ' drinks beer');
}else{
  console.log(firstName + ' drinks juice');
}
```

Switch Statement
================
The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case, as well as statements in cases that follow the matching case.

```javascript
switch (true) {
  case age < 13:
    console.log(firstName + ' is a boy.');
    break;
  case age >=13 && age <20 : 
    console.log(firstName + ' is a teenager.');
    break;
  case age >= 20 && age < 30 : 
    console.log(firstName + ' is a young man.');
    breake;
  default : 
    console.log(firstName + ' is a man.');
}
```
```javascript
if(age >= 13){
  console.log(firstName + ' is a boy.');
}if else(age >=13 && age <20){
  console.log(firstName + ' is a teenager.');
}if else(age >=20 && age <30){
  console.log(firstName + ' is a young man.');
}else{
  console.log(firstName + ' is a man.');
}
```
