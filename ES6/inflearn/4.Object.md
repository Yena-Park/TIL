```javaScript
var object = {
  foo: "bar",
  age: 42,
  baz: { myProp: 12}
}
```
Object initializer
==================
* Objects can be initialized using new Object(), Object.create(), or using the literal notation (initializer notation). An object initializer is a comma-delimited list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}).
* the advantage of the literal or initializer notation is, that you are able to quickly create objects with properties inside the curly braces. You simply notate a list of key: value pairs delimited by comma. The following code creates an object with three properties and the keys are "foo", "age" and "baz". The values of these keys are a string "bar", a number 42, and another object.
